Wild Turkey Rare Breed Bourbon is a barrel-proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon known for being an accessible, affordable and very good barrel-proof dram. A rare sight these days!

<!--more-->

First released in 1991, Rare Breed has seen four label iterations but has stayed true to Wild Turkey's traditional mashbill of 75% Indiana corn, 13% North East German rye, and 12% Minnesotan malted barley (all non-GMO), which is used for all of their bourbons. Although the label bears no age statement, Wild Turkey brand ambassadors have previously confirmed the blend contains 6, 8 and 12 year old bourbons.

> Uncut with water, Rare Breed is an uncompromised Kentucky bourbon with tones of sweet tobacco and hints of orange and mint, making it a remarkably smooth whiskey legend

Since it's release, Rare Breed has won many awards including gold medals at both the San Francisco World Spirits Competition and the International Wine & Spirits Competition. It's not hard to see why!

The bottle I'll be reviewing bears date code LL/HD072357, which [can be read](https://rarebird101.com/bottle-codes/) as bottled on the 7th of April 2019 at 23:57.

### Nose

Very dense, thick and spicy up front. There are subtle hints of black pepper, baking spices, cinnamon and seasoned oak (presumably from the 12 year old component of this blend). The nose opens up to a sweet burnt caramel and vanilla pods. Orange oil, runny honey and baked apples follow. You can definitely tell this a strong dram! 

### Palate

A big, bold, spicy punch in the face (but don't let that put you off)! Rare Breed has strong herbal notes with hints of barrel char and lots of spicy rye. This whiskey will stand up to a drop of water, if that's your thing. Doing so opens up the sweetness, and reduces the intensity of the spice. Whist a little oily and very mouth filling, after the wave of spice a little sweetness develops - cherry and brown sugar.

### Finish

The rye spiciness remains, with a little caramel and brown sugar lingering. Whilst not the longest finish, the subtle smokiness from the barrel char fills the mouth.

### Overall

Rare Breed is very typical of what you might expect from Wild Turkey, just bigger and bolder, owing to it's high proof. An all-round accessible and enjoyable barrel-proof whiskey. If you're just beginning to explore stronger bourbons, this would make a great starting point - and at just over £50 (the price we paid in the UK, September 2020) you can't really go wrong!
