Released in 2010, Arran Port Cask Finish Single Malt Scotch was introduced as part of Arran's ex-wine cask finish series, alongside an Amarone and a Sauternes cask finish.

<!--more-->

Although the bottle bears no age statement, Arran's website states that the single malt in this release is matured for approximately 8 years in traditional oak casks, before being transferred to ex-Port casks for finishing. As with all Arron whiskies, this bottle is non-chill filtered and contains no added colouring.

The bottle I'll be reviewing bears a bottling date of the 15th of July 2020, at 18:45.

> After initially maturing in traditional oak casks for approximately 8 years, The Arran Single Malt in this bottling was finished in a selection of Port casks sourced from an artisan producer of this iconic Portuguese fortified wine

### Nose

Intense, very typical, Port cask nose. Lots of sweet, almost jam like, forest fruit flavours. Somehow warming, though - like Glühwein/mulled wine. As it sits the impact of the Port cask subsides and an almond nutty sweetness develops. There's a little menthol and sugary sweetness here too. The nose finishes with malty biscuits.

### Palate

A very oily and almost velvety mouthfeel. Floral and fruity. There's a slight caramel/toffee-like sugariness - think like the burnt sugar you'd find on top of a crème brulee. Very subtle creamy hints too. Towards the end of the palate there's a dry fruitiness that I sometimes find in dry red wines.

### Finish

A medium-length dry, bitter finish - think red apple skins and lemon zest. The forest fruits and red berry tang lingers.

### Overall

If you like Port and you like a good single malt, this whisky is for you. The impact of the Port cask finish is deeply engrained in every aspect of this dram - even in the colour. With that said, although the spirit is great - very clean and light -  some could find the finish of this dram overpowering. At just under £45 (the price we paid in the UK, February 2021), we think it's worth a shot!
