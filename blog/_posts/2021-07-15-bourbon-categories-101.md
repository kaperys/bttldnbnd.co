Bourbon, Single Barrel, Kentucky Straight, Bottled in Bond - what's the difference? If you've ever wondered this, then this post is for you.

When it comes to categories of bourbon it can be confusing. Often bottles bare one or more of these categories (a whiskey can be any number of categories) on their label, but they're seldom explained. Here's our handy guide to some of the most commonly found.

### Bourbon

Bourbon is a distilled spirit originating in the United States in the late 1700s. To be called "bourbon", it must be made from at least 51% corn, distilled to no more than 80% ABV, produced in the United States and aged in new, charred oak containers (usually barrels). The spirit cannot enter the container at more than 62.5% ABV, or be bottled at less than 40% ABV.

Bourbon has no minimum aging requirements, unlike Scotch whisky. Although to be called "whiskey" in the EU, it must be aged for at least 3 years.

### Straight Bourbon

A straight bourbon, or any other "straight" spirit ("straight rye whiskey" for example) must be aged for a minimum of two years. Batching (see "small batch" below), chill filtration and proofing-down are the only modifications allowed prior to bottling.

If a "straight" spirit is aged for less than 4 years, the age of the youngest spirit contained in the blend must be stated on the bottle.

### Kentucky Straight Bourbon whiskey

For a bourbon to classify as Kentucky Straight Bourbon it must meet all the requirements of Straight Bourbon in addition to being distilled and aged for at least 1 year in Kentucky.

### Single Barrel

Single Barrel means the content of the bottle originated from one single barrel - no batching here!

### Small Batch

Although "Small Batch", unfortunately, has no legal definition, usually it implies that the content of a small number of barrels were combined to create a small batch of bottles with a uniform flavour.

### Bottled in Bond

Bottled in Bond, is an American legal act from 1897 which requires spirit producers to meet a specific set of requirements in order to bare the term on the label. "Bottled in Bond" is supposed to be a guarantee of a spirits production quality.
