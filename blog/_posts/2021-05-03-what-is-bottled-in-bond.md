"Bottled in Bond"... You'll have almost certainly heard the phrase, and maybe even own a couple of bottles, but what does the term actually mean?

"Bottled in bond" is an American designation, more than a century old, for spirits which have been aged and bottled according to the US government's Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits. Although the regulations apply to all spirits, practically, most "bonded" spirits are whiskey.

### But, why?

The [Bottled-in-Bond Act of 1897](https://definitions.uslegal.com/b/bottled-in-bond-act/) was introduced to provide a guarantee of a spirit's quality, as well as helped to ensure the proper accounting and collection of taxes. 

At the time the act was introduced whiskies often contained additives and flavorings such as iodide or other spirits, or sometimes worse, in order to stretch the whiskey. The federal government - the guarantor of the regulations - offered producers a tax incentive to participate in the Bottled-in-Bond Act.

### So what does it actually mean?

The Bottled-in-Bond Act requires that any spirit labelled "bottled in bond" must meet the following standards:

- It must be a product of a single distiller, made at a single distillery.
- It must be a product of a single distillation season (January to June or July to December).
- It must be aged in a federally bonded warehouse for at least four years.
- It must be bottled at 50% ABV (or 100 proof).
- The bottle label must state the distillery the spirit was distilled.
- The bottle label must state the distillery the spirit was bottled (if that's different from where it was distilled).

Bottled in bond is often considered similar in concept to single malt whisky or single barrel whiskey, but regarded as a better indication of a distiller's skill, given that the spirit is made by a single distiller at a single distillery in a single distillation season.
