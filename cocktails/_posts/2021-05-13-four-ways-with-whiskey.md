Here are four different whiskey-forward cocktails that will blow your mind!

<!--more-->

Some people have the opinion that whiskey doesn't belong in cocktails as it ‘taints' the whiskey. I'm here to prove them wrong. There are many ways to enjoy whiskey as part of a longer drink and this is often a way to introduce your taste buds to the flavour if you are just beginning your journey to becoming a whiskey drinker. If you enjoy a classic whiskey and with coke then go for it. There's no wrong way to drink whiskey as long as you enjoy it!

Here are four excellent whiskey cocktails to get your palate singing. We'll rate the difficulty of making the cocktail out of three; three being the most difficult and one being the easiest. We'll also include some tasting notes, to make sure its your kind of thing!

### Manhattan

A Manhattan is a great classic cocktail that really packs a punch. In our recipe, we use Bulleit Rye whiskey to give it a spicy kick and Antica Formula for the vermouth. Any high rye content whiskey would be a great alternative here, or you could use a classic bourbon or even a Canadian whiskey – try making a few and comparing your findings! 

Level of Difficulty: 1

Tasting Notes: Spicy with a little bitterness and a little sweetness from the cherry. This drink is surprisingly gentle on the palate - the perfect classy sipping cocktail!

#### Ingredients

- 50ml Bulleit Rye Whiskey (or your alternative)
- 25ml Sweet Vermouth 
- A couple of dashes of Angostura Bitters
- 1 Maraschino Cherry (optional, but very much recommended!)

#### Method

- Fill a mixing glass and a coupe or martini glass with ice. Place the coupe glass nearby, to chill.
- Pour the whiskey and vermouth into the mixing glass. Add the bitters to the top. Stir well with a bar spoon until the mixing glass is cold to the touch – a traditional Manhattan should always be stirred, not shaken.
- Empty the ice out of the now chilled coupe glass. Strain the cocktail straight into the glass.
- Garnish with a Maraschino Cherry skewered with a toothpick, rested on the top of the glass.
- Enjoy!

### Whiskey Sour

A Whiskey Sour is a great pre-dinner cocktail – or *aperitif*. This means that it's a great drink to whet your appetite – it sets you up nicely for a meal. The warming caramel notes of the bourbon contrast well with the sharp citrus flavour of the lemon juice and sweet simple syrup rounds the drink out well. It's a well-balanced, easy to drink, and most importantly, absolutely delicious cocktail. We use Buffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon in our recipe, but feel free to experiment with different ones!

Level of Difficulty: 3

Tasting Notes: Thick, velvety, sweet and sour. There's a reason sour cocktails have been so popular for so long. This one is boozy, but more-ish - so watch out!

#### Ingredients

- 50ml Buffalo Trace Bourbon (or your bourbon of choice)
- 35ml Lemon Juice
- 15ml Simple Syrup
- 30ml Fresh Egg White
- A Dash of Angostura Bitters
- A Maraschino Cherry and an Orange Slice, to garnish

#### Method

- Pour the whiskey, lemon juice, simple syrup and egg white into a cocktail shaker. Shake hard for roughly ten to fifteen seconds to emulsify the egg white – this is called *dry shaking*.
- Add plenty of ice to the cocktail shaker. Shake the cocktail again for roughly twenty seconds - this is called *wet shaking*.
- Add a couple of cubes of fresh ice to the serving glass – we like to use a whiskey tumbler for this one. Strain the contents of your cocktail shaker into the glass. Let the cocktail sit for a minute or so, until a nice white foam forms on the top.
- Add the Angostura Bitters to the top of the foam.
- Garnish with the cherry and an orange slice, skewered with a cocktail stick, if you fancy.
- Enjoy!

### BLT

~~Bacon, lettuce & tomato.~~ Oh wait, wrong blog post! This BLT is even more delicious than the sandwich. This one stands for Bourbon, Lemon & Tonic and this cocktail is the answer to all your warm Summer night whiskey cocktail needs. Light, refreshing, and oh-so-morish. What's not to love! The traditional whiskey for this cocktail is Bulleit Bourbon, but we love the vanilla notes that Maker's Mark Bourbon brings to our BLTs. If you order this in a bar, you can ask for bourbon & tonic water with a dash of lemon juice - it's a fairly new drink, so not so well known.

Level of Difficulty: 1

Tasting Notes: Light and lemon-y with a hint of sour. The tonic water helps to lengthen the drink while the creamy bourbon leaves a delicious caramel note on your palate. 

#### Ingredients

- 50ml Maker's Mark Bourbon (or bourbon of your choice)
- 25ml Lemon Juice
- Tonic Water, to top up
- Lemon Wedge, to garnish

#### Method

- Fill a whiskey tumbler with ice. Add the whiskey to the glass.
- Add the lemon juice to the glass and stir well. 
- Top up the glass with tonic water to taste. 
- Lightly squeeze the lemon wedge over the cocktail, and add it to the top of the glass. 
- Enjoy!

### Old Fashioned

What's the first cocktail that comes to mind when someone mentions whiskey? For me, its always an Old Fashioned. When made well, this cocktail is a perfectly balanced and timeless drink that you'll find yourself ordering (or making!) again and again. We like to use sugar for the first part of this recipe, but you could substitute it for simple syrup, if you'd prefer. For our recipe, we use Four Roses Bourbon for its sweetness, but an Old Fashioned is great with a Rye whiskey too. You'll sometimes see this drink made with half whiskey and half amaretto - known as an AB Sour. Try experimenting and see which you prefer!

Level of Difficulty: 2

Tasting Notes: Citrus-forward and well-rounded. The whiskey really shines through here and any ethanol notes are muted by the sweetness.

#### Ingredients

- 1/2 Teaspoon White Sugar (or a teaspoon of simple syrup)
- 1 Teaspoon of Water
- A Couple of Dashes of Angostura Bitters (Orange Bitters work great here as well!)
- 50ml Four Roses Bourbon (or whiskey of your choice)
- Orange peel, to garnish

#### Method

- Add the sugar and water to a whiskey tumbler and stir until the sugar is almost dissolved. Add the bitters. 
- Add ice to the glass - for this drink, we like to use one big, slow melting ice cube, but any will do. 
- Add the whiskey and stir gently. 
- Express the oils of the orange peel by gently squeezing over the top of the glass. Give the peel a twist, and lay it over the top of the drink.
- Enjoy!
